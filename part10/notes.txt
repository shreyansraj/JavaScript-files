* DOM Events: Events are signals that something has occured.
    Onclick(when an element is clicked)
    onmouseenter(when mouse enters an element)

Note: We can't perform multiple things on a single click on a button
 here comes the role of Evet Listener.

* Event Listener: addEventListener
    element.addEventListener(event, callback);
