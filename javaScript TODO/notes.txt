* Event Bubbling: 
  - Purpose: Event bubbling is a phase during event propagation where the event starts from the target element and moves up through its ancestors in the DOM hierarchy. 
             This is the default behavior for most events in the DOM.

* Event Delegation: 
  - Purpose: Event delegation is a concept where a single event listener is used to manage multiple similar elements efficiently. 
             This is achieved by attaching the event listener to a common ancestor of the elements and checking the target of the event to determine which 
             specific element triggered the event.

* DOM Manipulation: 
  - Purpose: Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) involves dynamically creating, modifying, or deleting HTML elements in response to user interactions. 
             In this TODO app, it's used to create new list items and delete existing ones.

* Input Handling: 
  - Purpose: Managing user input is crucial for tasks like adding new items to the TODO list. The JavaScript code retrieves and clears the input value 
             after adding a task to ensure a smooth user experience.

* Dynamic Element Creation: 
  - Purpose: Dynamically creating HTML elements, such as list items and buttons, allows the TODO app to generate content on-the-fly based on user input.

* Event Handling: 
  - Purpose: Event handling is employed to respond to user interactions, such as clicking the "Add Task" button or clicking the delete button on a task. 
             Event listeners are set up to execute specific actions in response to these events.
